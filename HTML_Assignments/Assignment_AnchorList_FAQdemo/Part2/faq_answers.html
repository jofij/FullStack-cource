            <h4>5. What are my options to receive technical support if I don't have a support plan?</h4>
            <p>Get answers to your technical questions in Microsoft Q&A, a community support channel where you can learn, connect, and exchange ideas with community experts, Microsoft engineers, and other customers. In addition, the robust search tool within Microsoft Q&A ingests answers from a variety of sources, making it a valuable self-help resource to meet your learning needs.</p>
            <ul type="square">
                <li>Technical support benefits may be available even if you don’t have a support plan. If you are a member of certain programs like MPN, MSDN or BizSpark, you may be eligible for limited Azure Support benefits from those Programs. Please refer to your service terms and conditions to understand your support options and benefits.</li>
                <li>Your Azure subscription includes access to subscription management support, e.g. billing, quota adjustment, account transfer, at no additional cost. You can get started with your request in the Azure Portal. In addition, Microsoft Azure subscriptions include access to the Azure Status Dashboard and the Microsoft Q&A to help you troubleshoot issues.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>6.How does Professional Direct Limited Advisory Support compare to Premier Advisory support?</h4>
            <p>Professional Direct (ProDirect) Advisory support provides you access to Azure Support guidance based on (1) publically available, best practices documentation regarding Microsoft Azure and (2) information from the Azure Forums. ProDirect advisors offer you support based on their access to Microsoft documentation, to the Microsoft Azure Support Engineers, and also to the Microsoft Azure product group. Best practices guidance may include, for example,</p>
            <ul type="square">
                <li>Planning for deployments and migrations</li>
                <li>Planning for hybrid cloud solutions</li>
                <li>Boosting performance</li>
                <li>Improving reliability and recoverability</li>
                <li>Enhancing security</li>
            </ul>
            <p>ProDirect, however, is more limited than Premier Advisory Support. ProDirect advisors do not provide detailed advisory assistance specific to an individual customer such as design, architecture, or code reviews; detailed instructions for application or configuration tuning (e.g., performance tuning); or the verification of specifications. ProDirect does not provide onsite support or engage in implementation activities such as, but not limited to, coding or configuration for customer development or deployment on Microsoft Azure.</p>

            <h4>7. What is a Preview (beta) service or feature? </h4>
            <p>Microsoft may provide access to Azure preview, beta, or other pre-release features, services, software, or regions, to obtain feedback and for evaluation purposes. Previews that are available are identified by a “Preview” tag in the Azure Portal. They are also listed on the Preview page or in the Preview section of the Azure Portal.</p>
            <p>There are many different kinds of Preview Services and Features for Microsoft Azure, with service availability and program access being the biggest differentiators:</p>
            <ul type="square">
                <li>Public Preview: made available to Microsoft Azure subscribers through the Azure Portal, these services are intended to be used as an early-look into what is coming and as a chance to test upcoming services and features.</li>
                <li>Private Preview: provided only to small subset of customers, in direct contact with the Azure Engineering teams, focused on direct and constant feedback during the development phase of a service</li>
                <li>Limited Preview: a fixed and limited number of customers can have access to this Preview program, and once a maximum threshold is met, no more users are allowed into the program.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When Microsoft offers you early access to Azure preview services and features, they are subject to reduced or different service terms as set forth in your service agreement and the preview supplemental terms. Preview Services and Features are provided “as-is”, “with all faults”, and “as available”, and are excluded from the Service SLAs or any Limited Warranties provided by Microsoft for Azure Services released to general availability (GA), and are made available to you on the condition that you agree to these terms of use, which supplement your agreement governing use of Microsoft Azure.</p>

            <h4>8. Do Azure Support Plans cover Preview (beta) services or features?</h4>
            <p>Support for Preview services and features is provided only for “Public Preview” programs (see FAQ above). Other non-Public Preview and/or Beta services may be supported through our forums or other channels. Azure Support plans do not cover non-Public Previews services.</p>
            <p>Generally, Azure paid support plans provide technical support for services and features in Public Preview. Some exceptions to the Public Preview support coverage applies, and services/features not covered on your support plan can be found here. Private or Limited previews are not included in the scope of the Azure Support plans and may or may not be supported through the Azure Forums.</p>
            <p>Technical support for a Public Preview service or feature is limited to break-fix scenarios and is available only in English with 24x7 support available for severities A and B (according to your support plan).</p>

            <h4>9. What are Azure Support Benefits and how do I get them?</h4>
            <p>Access to Azure technical support requires a paid support plan. However, some Microsoft programs could give you access to Azure technical support via Support Benefits even if you don’t have a paid support plan. The following programs include Azure Support Benefits:</p>
            <ul type="square">
                <li>MSDN and BizSpark</li>
                <li>Microsoft Partner Network</li>
                <li>Signature Cloud Support</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each of these programs will give you different support benefits, from response times to the number of requests that can be submitted. Please check the details of each program from the links above for more information.</p>
            <p>There are also some programs like MSDN and BizSpark Plus that give you other Microsoft Azure Benefits on top of access to Technical Support, such as monthly usage credits, free services and discounted consumption rates. Check the details of these programs for more information.</p>

            <h4>10. What is break-fix issue? </h4>
            <p>Break-fix issues are technical problems you experience while using Azure services. "Break-fix" is an industry term that refers to “work involved in supporting a technology when it fails in the normal course of its function, which requires intervention by a support organization to be restored to working order."</p>
